### Dependencies

To run this code, you must have the following Processing libraries installed:

*[GLGraphics](http://glgraphics.sourceforge.net/)
*[Toxiclibs](http://toxiclibs.org/)
*[Proscene](http://code.google.com/p/proscene/)


### Usage

Press spacebar twice to toggle between first person and third person viewing mode.  Pressing different numbered keys will trigger presets which move the camera around the scene in various ways. In first person mode (the default), you can fly the camera around the scene by dragging the mouse, and zoom with two finger-scroll.
