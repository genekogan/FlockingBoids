## Flocking Boids

A fancy implementation in Processing of [Craig Reynolds' Boids program](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/), simulating the flocking behavior of birds. Check the [video link](https://vimeo.com/39517129) to see what it looks like.

### Dependencies

To run the code, you need [Processing](http://processing.org) with the following libraries installed:

* [GLGraphics](http://glgraphics.sourceforge.net/)
* [Toxiclibs](http://toxiclibs.org/)
* [Proscene](http://code.google.com/p/proscene/)


### Usage

Press the spacebar twice to toggle between first person and third person viewing mode. While in first person mode only (the default), you can fly the camera around the scene by click-dragging the mouse, and zoom with two finger-scroll (mac) or the equivalent. While in third person mode, pressing different numbered keys will trigger third-person presets moving the camera around the scene in various ways.
